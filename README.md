# TryHackMe-Walkthroughs


This repository contains my walkthroughs of different rooms from TryHackMe's Offensive Pentesting learning path. These notes were taken while completing the rooms and are written in a blog-style format, documenting my thought process, challenges I faced, and the solutions implemented. 

The goal of these walkthroughs is to enhance my penetration testing skills while improving my technical and report writing abilities. I hope that these resources prove helpful to others navigating this learning path.
