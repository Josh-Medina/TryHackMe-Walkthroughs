# TryHackMe-Walkthroughs


This repository contains my walkthroughs of different rooms from TryHackMe's Offensive Pentesting learning path. These notes were taken while completing the rooms and are written in a blog-style format, documenting my thought process, challenges, and solutions. 

The goal is to get better at the penetration testing process while improving my technical and report writing skills. Hopefully these walkthroughs are helpful to others completing this path.
